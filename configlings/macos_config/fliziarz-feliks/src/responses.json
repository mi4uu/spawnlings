    "response": "Issuer's Response: Thank you for your response. We have shared the merchant's response with our cardholder. We are changing the dispute reason from 13.1 to 13.3. Merchant did not remedy the dispute. Our cardholder states paid One Up services to manage and run the cardholder's existing Online Walmart Store (Walmart consulting management services) which included (A) maintain clients store including configure the walmart storefront and configuring the front and back end systems necessary to manage the store. (B) Review, research, source, select and list products for the lient's store. (C) respond to customer's phone and email inquiries, handle product returns and manage billing matters. (D). Maintain oversight of client's store and its financial performance. The cardholder states merchant took almost 2 months to set up the services for the store and the store went live on 05/16/2022. The store was live for a week and the first 6 of 6 orders were not shipped. One Up was responsible for shipping and fulfillment services as well and since they failed to ship the first 6 orders, Walmart suspended the cardholder store. Apart from that there were pricing issues with the items sold on his website where the merchant is changing exorbitant amounts than what the actual market value of the products. We have attached proof of the same, which ultimately lead to Walmart shutting down the cardholder's store, making the service of no use to the cardholder. The cardholder states made repeated attempts to notify the merchant that the management was not fulfilling orders and the pricing was inconsistant and inappropriate than the market value but the merchant did not act upon it and led to the suspension of the cardholder existing Walmart store. The cardholder has made multiple attempts to resolve with the merchant via email. The cardholder reached out to the merchant on 06/06/2022 via email (attached for your reference) who stated since Walmart has suspended the store, the customer will have to create a new store and new LLC and start the process all over again if he wishes to sell with Walmart again. The merchant states they offered to sell on facebook stores and amazon stores if the customer decides to, however our cardholder denied and is not obligated to accept an alternate and would like a refund as the services were not as described and caused damage to this existing online store leading it to be suspended. Merchant also stated that they would need additional credit card details other personal details to start up a new store. The cardholder cancelled the services with the merchant on 06/08/2022 via email. The merchant has not responded post 06/09/2022 and is unwilling to provide a refund. The merchant s response claims that service has been rendered by paying the 3rd party vendor (One UP Services), this however is not a valid proof of service rendered, The MCC that the merchant used is 7399 BUSINESS SERVICES NO and it does not state that it was for a funds transfer. Invalid remedy. The merchant s policy holds no bearing with this dispute condition code. The merchant failed to provide documentation to prove that the cardholder or an authorized person received the service as described. We have also provided a second opinion letter from 3D Stage builders to support the claim. The merchant has failed to provide any evidence showing One Up provided services to the cardholder as described. Proof of payment does not constitute as proof of services rendered. taking into consideration all these points, kindly accept this dispute or issue a refund for the full amount.",
